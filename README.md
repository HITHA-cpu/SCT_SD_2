**Number Guessing Game**

This is a simple terminal-based game where the program generates a random number within a specified range (1 to 100). The user is challenged to guess the number by inputting their guesses. After each guess, the program provides feedback informing the user if their guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the user successfully guesses the generated number.

**Features:**

Random number generation between 1 and 100.

User input validation for integers within the range.

Helpful feedback on each guess to guide the player.

Interactive and engaging command-line interface.

**Purpose:**

Created as an internship assignment to practice implementing control flow, user input handling, and random number generation in Python (or other programming languages).

**Usage:**

Run the program in your terminal and follow the prompts to play the guessing game.
